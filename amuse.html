    <h1>Amusing Websites</h1>
    <h3>by Katie Nord</h3>
    <p>These are some of my favorite websites that you might find amusing. Please enjoy!</p>

    <h2>The Useless Web</h2>
    <p>This is a website where, whenever you click the button, it will take you to a random website. It is a great way to cure your boredom.</p>

    <h2>Akinator</h2>
    <p>Here is a website I loved when I was a kid. This is Akinator, an AI guessing game that guesses the character your thinking through a series of questions. It is a lot of fun trying to stump the genie.</p>
