  <p> Dana Terrace is the director and creator of the Disney Animated series <em>"The Owl House"</em>. Terrace is an inspiration for young artists who broke the barrier of representation by creating one of Disney's first cannonical LGBTQ+ characters in her series.</p>
  <p> Sadly, <em>"The Owl House"</em> has been cancelled and will be airing the final episode on April 8th, 2023. For all the young artsits and fans who want to learn more about animation and storytelling, Terrace is a wonderful role model to look up to.</p>
